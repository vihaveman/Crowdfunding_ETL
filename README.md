# Crowdfunding_ETL

 In this project, I worked with my partner to create an ETL pipeline using Python, Pandas, Python dictionary methods and regular expressions to extract and transform data. 

After transforming the data, we created four CSV files which we then used to create an ERD and a table schema. Finally, we load the CSV data files into a Postgres database.
